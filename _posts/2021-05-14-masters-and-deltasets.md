title: Masters and delta sets - a note to self
---

Here's another thing which I always forget when I'm building variable fonts, and when I say "building variable fonts", I mean "building things which build variable fonts".

We all know that each glyph in variable font is made up of the contour of the default master, stored in the `glyf` table, and then, for each master, the deltas between each point on the default contour and the contour for that master, stored in the `gvar` table, right?

_WRONG_. Horribly wrong.

Or rather: deceptively correct in simple cases, which is why I always forget it, but horribly wrong in the general case. Specifically, if you put your masters in at the ends of your axes like this, it'll work:

But the moment you start putting masters into the corners (or worse, the middle), like this:

then it all falls apart...

(The _really_ annoying thing is that I solved this problem once already when I wrote Babelfont, and then last week when I came to implementing a new variable font builder in Rust, I completely forgot why the problem was happening and how to solve it. So, [once again](https://simoncozens.github.io/userspace-and-designspace/), I'm writing this down to try to ensure that I don't confuse myself again next time I come up against this.)

Why is this happening? The simple answer is that the deltas stored inside a font are _not_ deltas between the default master and other design masters. But to find out what they _are_, let's take a look using the example of Nunito again. Here is its master configuration in designspace coordinates:

| Master               | Weight | Italic |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| ExtraLight.ufo       | 42     | 0      |
| M500.ufo             | 125    | 0      |
| M1000.ufo            | 208    | 0      |
| ExtraLightItalic.ufo | 42     | 9      |
| M500SlantItalic.ufo  | 125    | 9      |
| M1000SlantItalic.ufo | 208    | 9      |

One default master (the ExtraLight), and five variation masters. Notably, there are intermediate masters, wght=125,ital=0 and wght=125,ital=9. Let's just think about the weight axis and ignore the italic for now.

**The key to understanding variable font interpolation is to ask the question "How much should each master contribute at a given point?"**

So at wght=42, none of the variation masters should contribute any deltas. At the other end of the axis, wght=208, the `M1000.ufo` master should contribute all of its deltas, and the `M500.ufo` master should contribute none. Those cases are obvious. When we're sitting on an intermediate master, wght=125, _that master_ (`M500.ufo`) master should contribute _all_ of its deltas, and nothing else on the weight axis should contribute any deltas.

Now think about the midpoints between masters. At wght=83.5, the `M500.ufo` master should contribute half of its deltas and the `M1000.ufo` master should still not be involved in interpolation at all, and hence not contribute any deltas. Still quite obvious.

At the other midpoint, wght=166.5, things start to get non-obvious. You might think that things are set up so that `M500.ufo` contributes all of its deltas, and then `M1000.ufo` contributes half of its deltas, but they wouldn't be half of the deltas between `M1000` and the _default_ master any more, but half of the deltas between itself and `M500.ufo`, and that gets really awkward with multiple axes. Instead, the `M500.ufo` master should contribute _half_ of its deltas and the `M1000.ufo` master should _also_ contribute half its deltas. And as we established above, when we're at the far end of the axis, we want the `M500.ufo` master to contribute nothing. So Semibold is _not_ "go to Regular and then go half way from there to Bold", but a blend of half of Regular and half of Bold. (Convince yourself that this is the case before going further.)

So these masters provide contributions in triangular patterns, with the output being the sum of the contributions of all masters. These triangles - sometimes called "regions" or "tents" - have a start point, a peak point (100% contribution) and an end point. These start/peak/end tuples are also called [supports](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_(mathematics)>), because in mathematics a support is the region for which a function is active.

Obviously, a master at location X has 100% contribution at X. But the starts and end points is less obvious. Note that the M1000 master does _not_ start contributing until _after_ we've got past the intermediate master. The mistake I've made, both times I've tried implementing this, is to treat each master independently, throw in all the deltas, and hope for the best. Laurence Penny's wonderful [Samsa](https://lorp.github.io/samsa/src/samsa-gui.html) tool helpfully shows the tents for us, and you can see clearly what I did wrong:

> _The brown arrows should not be there._

You can see that at halfway down the weight axis, I have 100% contribution from `M500.ufo`, which is great, but I _also_ have 50% contribution of `M1000.ufo`, which is not so great. You can see why I made the mistake: if the intermediate master wasn't there, I _would_ want 50% of the `M1000.ufo` master to get me halfway down the weight axis. But with the intermediate master, I'm already where I want to be, so the contribution should have been zero, but instead I've ended up by applying two sets of deltas instead of one.

So setting the starts and ends of the tents requires looking at all the masters together and determining the values for each master depends on its position in the designspace and its relationship to all the other masters.

Now let's think about the italic axis, and this is where it gets really horrible because we now have masters which contribute to two axes at once. Our final two masters:

| Master               | Weight | Italic |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| M500SlantItalic.ufo  | 125    | 9      |
| M1000SlantItalic.ufo | 208    | 9      |

tell us what should happen as _both_ weight and slope varies.

In this case, we need to not only set the tents correctly, but we also need to _change the deltas themselves_.

Let's suppose we're at wght=208, italic=9. What contributions should we expect? Here's one option: `M1000SlantItalic.ufo` contributes 100% and gets us to the place we want to be, and nothing else contributes anything. Unfortunately it turns out to be impossible to get that to work _and_ to create linear, triangular, tents for all the other masters to work properly. I can't explain why not, because honestly, it's starting to get beyond me at this point.

Instead, here's what actually happens in OpenType: `M1000.ufo` contributes 100% (to get us to the end of the weight axis), and `ExtraLightItalic.ufo` contributes 100% (to get us to the end of the italic axis), and then `M1000SlantItalic.ufo` _also_ contributes 100% of its deltas, but - and this is the critical bit - the deltas here _aren't_ the deltas between the default master and the `M1000SlantItalic.ufo` (otherwise we would have a double application again). The deltas we write for the deltaset representing the `M1000SlantItalic.ufo` master are actually a kind of correction value - they're the deltas between where we already got to when we applied 100% of `M100.ufo` plus 100% of `ExtraLightItalic.ufo`, and where we want to get to based on the points in `M1000SlantItalic.ufo`.

Samsa calls these deltasets "order 2 deltasets", because they're deltasets based on another delta set. This is where the concept of higher order interpolation comes from, which you might have heard about elsewhere.

The _other_ mistake I make when implementing variable font builders is to just throw in all the deltas from default master to `M1000SlantItalic.ufo`, instead of doing this higher-order delta operation. This results in massive deltas, which _also_ get doubly applied because now there's no sensible way to compute the start/end regions, and the end result is a complete mess:

<img src="/images/samsa-2.png" width=600>

The way to fix both mistakes is to use a proper [variation model](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/blob/main/Lib/fontTools/varLib/models.py), which computes both the supports and the correct deltas by considering all the masters in combination and by applying higher-order deltas. Which is why I spent two days this week porting `fontTools.varLib.models`, first to [TypeScript](https://github.com/simoncozens/manumit/blob/main/ts/varmodel.ts) and then to [Rust](https://github.com/simoncozens/fonttools-rs/blob/main/src/otvar/locations.rs).

Maybe next time, I'll actually remember these problems, and build in the variation model from the start.
